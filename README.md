MyToken
MyToken is an ERC20-compatible token smart contract implemented in Solidity, designed for deploying custom tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. It includes essential functions such as transferring tokens between addresses, approving spending of tokens by another address, and safely managing token minting and burning operations. The contract ensures compliance with the ERC20 standard while providing straightforward functionality for token management. It leverages OpenZeppelin's library for access control (via Ownable) and SafeMath for secure arithmetic operations to prevent overflow and underflow errors.

Execution Instructions
To deploy and interact with MyToken, follow these steps:

Clone the Repository
bash
git clone [https://github.com/mayank_5354/MyToken.git](https://github.com/mayank5354/eth-proof-.sol/blob/eth/eth%20proof%20.sol)
cd MyToken
Install Dependencies
Ensure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed.

bash
npm install @openzeppelin/contracts
npm install --save-dev hardhat
Compile the Contract
Use Hardhat to compile the Solidity contract.

bash
npx hardhat compile
Deploy the Contract
Deploy the contract to a local Ethereum network (e.g., Hardhat Network) for testing purposes.

bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
Interact with the Contract
Use tools like Hardhat console or Remix IDE to interact with the deployed contract. Example interactions include minting tokens, transferring tokens between addresses, and burning tokens.

Key Features
ERC20 Standard Compliance: Implements standard ERC20 token interface with functions for token transfers, allowances, and supply queries.
Access Control: Utilizes Ownable from OpenZeppelin for managing ownership and access control, allowing only the contract owner to mint tokens.
Safe Arithmetic Operations: Implements SafeMath for arithmetic operations to prevent integer overflow and underflow vulnerabilities.
Flexibility: Supports customization of token parameters such as name, symbol, decimals, and initial supply upon deployment.
